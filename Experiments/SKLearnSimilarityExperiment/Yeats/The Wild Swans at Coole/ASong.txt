A SONG

I THOUGHT no more was needed
Youth to prolong
Than dumb-bell and foil
To keep the body young.
i{O who could have foretold
That the heart grows old?}

Though I have many words,
What woman's satisfied,
I am no longer faint
Because at her side?
i{O who could have foretold
That the heart grows old?}

I have not lost desire
But the heart that I had;
I thought 'twould burn my body
Laid on the death-bed,
i{For who could have foretold
That the heart grows old?}
