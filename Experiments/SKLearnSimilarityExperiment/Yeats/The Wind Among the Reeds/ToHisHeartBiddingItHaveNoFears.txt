TO HIS HEART, BIDDING IT HAVE NO FEAR

BE you still, be you still, trembling heart;
Remember the wisdom out of the old days:
i{Him who trembles before the flame and the flood,}
i{And the winds that blow through the starry ways,}
i{Let the starry winds and the flame and the flood}
i{Cover over and hide, for he has no part}
i{With the lonely, majestical multitude.}
