THE GREY ROCK

i{Poets with whom I learned my trade.}
i{Companions of the Cheshire Cheese,}
i{Here's an old story I've remade,}
i{Imagining 'twould better please}
i{Your cars than stories now in fashion,}
i{Though you may think I waste my breath}
i{Pretending that there can be passion}
i{That has more life in it than death,}
i{And though at bottling of your wine}
i{Old wholesome Goban had no say;}
i{The moral's yours because it's mine.}

When cups went round at close of day --
Is not that how good stories run? --
The gods were sitting at the board
In their great house at Slievenamon.
They sang a drowsy song, Or snored,
For all were full of wine and meat.
The smoky torches made a glare
On metal Goban'd hammered at,
On old deep silver rolling there
Or on some still unemptied cup
That he, when frenzy stirred his thews,
Had hammered out on mountain top
To hold the sacred stuff he brews
That only gods may buy of him.

Now from that juice that made them wise
All those had lifted up the dim
Imaginations of their eyes,
For one that was like woman made
Before their sleepy eyelids ran
And trembling with her passion said,
'Come out and dig for a dead man,
Who's burrowing Somewhere in the ground
And mock him to his face and then
Hollo him on with horse and hound,
For he is the worst of all dead men.'

i{We should be dazed and terror-struck,}
i{If we but saw in dreams that room,}
i{Those wine-drenched eyes, and curse our luck}
i{That emptied all our days to come.}
i{I knew a woman none could please,}
i{Because she dreamed when but a child}
i{Of men and women made like these;}
i{And after, when her blood ran wild,}
i{Had ravelled her own story out,}
i{And said, 'In two or in three years}
i{I needs must marry some poor lout,'}
i{And having said it, burst in tears.}

i{Since, tavern comrades, you have died,}
i{Maybe your images have stood,}
i{Mere bone and muscle thrown aside,}
i{Before that roomful or as good.}
i{You had to face your ends when young --}
i{'Twas wine or women, or some curse --}
i{But never made a poorer song}
i{That you might have a heavier purse,}
i{Nor gave loud service to a cause}
i{That you might have a troop of friends,}
i{You kept the Muses' sterner laws,}
i{And unrepenting faced your ends,}
i{And therefore earned the right -- and yet}
i{Dowson and Johnson most I praise -- }
i{To troop with those the world's forgot,}
i{And copy their proud steady gaze.}

'The Danish troop was driven out
Between the dawn and dusk,' she said;
'Although the event was long in doubt.
Although the King of Ireland's dead
And half the kings, before sundown
All was accomplished.

'When this day
Murrough, the King of Ireland's son,
Foot after foot was giving way,
He and his best troops back to back
Had perished there, but the Danes ran,
Stricken with panic from the attack,
The shouting of an unseen man;
And being thankful Murrough found,
Led by a footsole dipped in blood
That had made prints upon the ground,
Where by old thorn-trees that man stood;
And though when he gazed here and there,
He had but gazed on thorn-trees, spoke,
'Who is the friend that seems but air
And yet could give so fine a stroke?'
Thereon a young man met his eye,
Who said, 'Because she held me in
Her love, and would not have me die,
Rock-nurtured Aoife took a pin,
And pushing it into my shirt,
Promised that for a pin's sake
No man should see to do me hurt;
But there it's gone; I will not take
The fortune that had been my shame
Seeing, King's son, what wounds you have.  --
'Twas roundly spoke, but when night came
He had betrayed me to his grave,
For he and the King's son were dead.
I'd promised him two hundred years,
And when for all I'd done or said --
And these immortal eyes shed tears --
He claimed his country's need was most,
I'd saved his life, yet for the sake
Of a new friend he has turned a ghost.
What does he care if my heart break?
I call for spade and horse and hound
That we may harry him.' Thereon
She cast herself upon the ground
And rent her clothes and made her moan:
'Why are they faithless when their might
Is from the holy shades that rove
The grey rock and the windy light?
Why should the faithfullest heart most love
The bitter sweetness of false faces?
Why must the lasting love what passes,
Why are the gods by men betrayed?'

But thereon every god stood up
With a slow smile and without sound,
And Stretching forth his arm and cup
To where she moaned upon the ground,
Suddenly drenched her to the skin;
And she with Goban's wine adrip,
No more remembering what had been.
Stared at the gods with laughing lip.

i{I have kept my faith, though faith was tried,}
i{To that rock-born, rock-wandering foot,}
i{And the world's altered since you died,}
i{And I am in no good repute}
i{With the loud host before the sea,}
i{That think sword-strokes were better meant}
i{Than lover's music -- let that be,}
i{So that the wandering foot's content.}
